# group repository project
This repository contains four parallel stage Jenkins jobs.
Each parallel job contains two stages committed by two different team members.
Each stage contains a bash script checking for the operating system statistics, as well as the system status check of Jenkins.
This repository is protected in such a way that developers without the write permission may not deploy codes directly into main branch.
